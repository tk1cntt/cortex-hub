# Cortex Hub — Current State

> Auto-read by agents at session start. Update at session end.

## Active Phase
- **Phase:** 6 (Polish, docs, testing, GA release)
- **Gate Passed:** Gate 5 (Phase 5→6) on 2026-03-19

## In Progress
- [/] Indexing pipeline testing on real repositories
- [/] Agent quality strategy documentation

## Completed (Phase 6)
- [x] Dashboard API — 9 real routes (no stubs)
- [x] Dashboard Web — 8 pages, full-featured
- [x] GitNexus indexing pipeline (clone → analyze → mem0 ingest)
- [x] Workflow system (conventions, per-project profiles)
- [x] Branch-scoped knowledge (mem0 user_id namespacing, fallback chain)
- [x] Enhanced IndexingPanel (branch dropdown, diff view, per-branch status, 1.5s realtime polling)
- [x] MCP branch-aware tools (memory.store/search + code.search/impact with projectId/branch)
- [x] 3 new backend endpoints (branches listing, diff, per-branch index summary)
- [x] Docker rebuilt and deployed with latest code

## Recent Decisions
- mem0 branch scope: `project-{id}:branch-{name}` for branch, `project-{id}` for project fallback
- Branch diff uses `git diff --name-status origin/base...origin/branch`
- Branch listing via `git ls-remote --heads` (no cloning required)

## Quality Status
- Build ✅ | Typecheck ✅ | Lint ✅
- Docker ✅ (container recreated 2026-03-20T03:38Z)
- All 4 services healthy: qdrant, neo4j, cliproxy, mem0
